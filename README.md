Objective

The objective of this project is to build and visualize a Decision Tree Classification Model using scikit-learn on a chosen dataset. The aim is to understand how decision trees make predictions, evaluate model accuracy, interpret decision rules, and generate a visual representation of the trained model. This helps in gaining insights into feature importance, decision boundaries, and prediction patterns.

Key Activities
· Data Preprocessing

Cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling categorical values, converting labels into numeric form, and applying one-hot encoding to ensure the data can be used for machine-learning algorithms.

· Dataset Splitting

Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.

· Model Building

Implementing a DecisionTreeClassifier with appropriate parameters (such as max_depth) and training the model using the training data.

· Model Evaluation

Calculating accuracy using the test dataset and generating predictions to assess how well the decision tree performs.

· Model Visualization

Creating a complete Decision Tree plot using plot_tree() to visualize decision paths, feature splits, gini impurity, and predicted classes.
